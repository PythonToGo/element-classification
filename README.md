### Task 1: Deep Learning
Build a deep learning model to classify images into three categories: resistors, integrated circuits (ICs), and capacitors.

**Dataset**  
You have access to a labeled dataset containing images of electronic components. Each image is associated with one of the following classes:
- Resistor
- IC
- Capacitor

**Requirements**  
- Data Preprocessing: Get to know the dataset and prepare it for the training, validation, and testing of your model.
- Model Architecture: Choose or design a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture suitable for multi-class classification. You can use pre-trained models as a starting point or build your own from scratch.
- Training: Train the model on the training data. Feel free to experiment with hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and optimizer.
- Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using appropriate metrics.

**Implementation Details**  
- Programming Language: Python
- Deep Learning Framework: Choose either PyTorch or TensorFlow.
- Submission: Provide the trained model, all code, and a brief report summarizing your approach and results (can also be included in comments or markdowns).

### Task 2: Image Processing
Your task is to segment the components in the images of the classes capacitor and resistor. You don't have to implement it, simply describe your approach. Your theoretical tool list is Python and OpenCV. List all the processing steps you would take to segment the components in the images. You can also list different approaches if several come to your mind.
